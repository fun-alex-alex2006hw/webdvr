Web based DVR scheduling for HDHomerun using Raspberry Pi, NodeJS and Firebase.

TODO LIST
==========
1. Manage Schedule Conflicts
2. Optionally use second tuner
3. Ensure Naming makes sense for all that is recorded.
4. Upgrade to using HDHomerun nodejs package (currently using shell script with hdhomerun_config installed
5. Store off recording history (for failure conditions)
6. Implement Record Now (and start recording if no conflicts exist, rather than in the past)
7. Enable Complete Series recording
8. Enable New episodes recording
9. Replace boring text with pictures (a la netflix style)
